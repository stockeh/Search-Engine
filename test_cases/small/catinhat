The Cat in the Hat

By Dr. Seuss

The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house
All that cold, cold, wet day.

I sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.
And I said, "How I wish
We had something to do!"

Too wet to go out
And too cold to play ball.
So we sat in the house.
We did nothing at all.

So all we could do was to

Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!

And we did not like it.
Not one little bit.

BUMP!

And then
something went BUMP!
How that bump made us jump!

We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
We looked!
And we saw him!
The Cat in the Hat!
And he said to us,
"Why do you sit there like that?"
"I know it is wet
And the sun is not sunny.
But we can have
Lots of good fun that is funny!"

"I know some good games we could play,"
Said the cat.
"I know some new tricks,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"A lot of good tricks.
I will show them to you.
Your mother
Will not mind at all if I do."

Then Sally and I
Did not know what to say.
Our mother was out of the house
For the day.

But our fish said, "No! No!
Make that cat go away!
Tell that Cat in the Hat
You do NOT want to play.
He should not be here.
He should not be about.
He should not be here
When your mother is out!"

"Now! Now! Have no fear.
Have no fear!" said the cat.
"My tricks are not bad,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"Why, we can have
Lots of good fun, if you wish,
with a game that I call
UP-UP-UP with a fish!"

"Put me down!" said the fish.
"This is no fun at all!
Put me down!" said the fish.
"I do NOT wish to fall!"

"Have no fear!" said the cat.
"I will not let you fall.
I will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a book on one hand!
And a cup on my hat!
But that is not ALL I can do!"
Said the cat...

"Look at me!
Look at me now!" said the cat.
"With a cup and a cake
On the top of my hat!
I can hold up TWO books!
I can hold up the fish!
And a litte toy ship!
And some milk on a dish!
And look!
I can hop up and down on the ball!
But that is not all!
Oh, no.
That is not all...

"Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me NOW!
It is fun to have fun
But you have to know how.
I can hold up the cup
And the milk and the cake!
I can hold up these books!
And the fish on a rake!
I can hold the toy ship
And a little toy man!
And look! With my tail
I can hold a red fan!
I can fan with the fan
As I hop on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh, no.
That is not all...."

That is what the cat said...
Then he fell on his head!
He came down with a bump
From up there on the ball.
And Sally and I,
We saw ALL the things fall!

And our fish came down, too.
He fell into a pot!
He said, "Do I like this?"
Oh, no! I do not.
This is not a good game,"
Said our fish as he lit.
"No, I do not like it,
Not one little bit!"

"Now look what you did!"
Said the fish to the cat.
"Now look at this house!
Look at this! Look at that!
You sank our toy ship,
Sank it deep in the cake.
You shook up our house
And you bent our new rake.
You SHOULD NOT be here
When our mother is not.
You get out of this house!"
Said the fish in the pot.

"But I like to be here.
Oh, I like it a lot!"
Said the Cat in the Hat
To the fish in the pot.
"I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to go!
And so," said the Cat in the Hat,

"So
so
so...

I will show you
Another good game that I know!"
And then he ran out.
And, then, fast as a fox,
The Cat in the Hat
Came back in with a box.
A big red wood box.
It was shut with a hook.
"Now look at this trick,"
Said the cat.
"Take a look!"

Then he got up on top
With a tip of his hat.
"I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,"
Said the cat.
"In this box are two things
I will show to you now.
You will like these two things,"
Said the cat with a bow.

"I will pick up the hook.
You will see something new.
Two things. And I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun."
Then, out of the box
Came Thing Two and Thing One!
And they ran to us fast.
They said, "How do you do?
Would you like to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two?"

And Sally and I
Did not know what to do.
So we had to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two.
We shook their two hands.
But our fish said, "No! No!
Those Things should not be
In this house! Make them go!
"They should not be here
When your mother is not!
Put them out! Put them out!"
Said the fish in the pot.

"Have no fear, little fish,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"These Things are good Things."
And he gave them a pat.
"They are tame. Oh, so tame!
They have come here to play.
They will give you some fun
On this wet, wet, wet day."

"Now, here is a game that they like,"
Said the cat.
"They like to fly kites,"
Said the Cat in the Hat

"No! Not in the house!"
Said the fish in the pot.
"They should not fly kites
In a house! They should not.
Oh, the things they will bump!
Oh, the things they will hit!
Oh, I do not like it!
Not one little bit!" Then Sally and I
Saw them run down the hall.
We saw those two Things
Bump their kites on the wall!
Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Down the wall in the hall.

Thing Two and Thing One!
They ran up! They ran down!
On the string of one kite
We saw Mother's new gown!
Her gown with the dots
That are pink, white and red.
Then we saw one kite bump
On the head of her bed!

Then those Things ran about
With big bumps, jumps and kicks
And with hops and big thumps
And all kinds of bad tricks.
And I said,
"I do NOT like the way that they play
If Mother could see this,
Oh, what would she say!"

Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"
And our fish shook with fear.
"Your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh, what will she do to us?
What will she say?
Oh, she will not like it
To find us this way!"

"So, DO something! Fast!" said the fish.
"Do you hear!
I saw her. Your mother!
Your mother is near!
So, as fast as you can,
Think of something to do!
You will have to get rid of
Thing One and Thing Two!"

So, as fast as I could,
I went after my net.
And I said, "With my net
I can get them I bet.
I bet, with my net,
I can get those Things yet!"

Then I let down my net.
It came down with a PLOP!
And I had them! At last!
Thoe two Things had to stop.
Then I said to the cat,
"Now you do as I say.
You pack up those Things
And you take them away!"

"Oh dear!" said the cat,
"You did not like our game...
Oh dear.

What a shame!
What a shame!
What a shame!"

Then he shut up the Things
In the box with the hook.
And the cat went away
With a sad kind of look.

"That is good," said the fish.
"He has gone away. Yes.
But your mother will come.
She will find this big mess!
And this mess is so big
And so deep and so tall,
We ca not pick it up.
There is no way at all!"

And THEN!
Who was back in the house?
Why, the cat!
"Have no fear of this mess,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"I always pick up all my playthings
And so...
I will show you another
Good trick that I know!"

Then we saw him pick up
All the things that were down.
He picked up the cake,
And the rake, and the gown,
And the milk, and the strings,
And the books, and the dish,
And the fan, and the cup,
And the ship, and the fish.
And he put them away.
Then he said, "That is that."
And then he was gone
With a tip of his hat.

Then our mother came in
And she said to us two,
"Did you have any fun?
Tell me. What did you do?"

And Sally and I did not know
What to say.
Should we tell her
The things that went on there that day?

Should we tell her about it?
Now, what SHOULD we do?
Well...
What would YOU do
If your mother asked YOU?

How The Grinch Stole Christmas
by Dr. Suess

Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot...
But the Grinch,Who lived just north of Whoville, Did NOT!
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
But I think that the most likely reason of all,
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes,
He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos,
Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown,
At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath,
Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.
"And they're hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a sneer,
"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"
Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
"I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!"
For Tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys,
Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!
And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!
Noise! Noise! Noise!
That's one thing he hated! The NOISE!
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast.
And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!
FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast beast.
Which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!
And THEN They'd do something He liked least of all!
Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!
They'd sing! And they'd sing! And they'd SING!
SING! SING! SING!
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing,
The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"
"Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!"
"I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?"
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
"I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!"
"With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Nick!"
"All I need is a reindeer..." The Grinch looked around.
But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.
Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said,
"If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead!"
So he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread,
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,
On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!" And the sleigh started down,
Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.
When he came to the first little house on the square.
"This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed,
And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
"These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Around the whole room, and he took every present!
Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!
Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,
Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!
He took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who-hash!
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
"And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!"
And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who!
Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two.
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,
Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
She stared at the Grinch and said, "Santy Claus, why,
"Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"
But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,
He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
"Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied,
"There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side."
"So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear."
"I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here."
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,
And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup,
HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!
Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!
Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar.
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food That he left in the house,
Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then He did the same thing To the other Whos' houses
Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos' mouses!
It was quarter past dawn... All the Whos, still a-bed,
All the Whos, still asnooze When he packed up his sled,
Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!
The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!
Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
"PoohPooh to the Whos!" he was grinchishly humming.
"They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!"
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!"
"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!"
"That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "That I simply MUST hear!"
So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low. Then it started to grow.
But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!
It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Was singing! Without any presents at all!
He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!
Somehow or other, it came just the same!
And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,
Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?"
"It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!"
"It came without packages, boxes or bags!"
And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!
"Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store."
"Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!"
And what happened then? Well...in Whoville they say,
That the Grinch's small heart Grew three sizes that day!
And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,
And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
And he, HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!

Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish.
This one has a littlecar.
This one has a little star.
Say! What a lot of fish there are.
Yes. Some are red, and some are blue.
Some are old and some are new.
Some are sad, and some are glad,
And some are very, very bad.
Why are they sad and glad and bad?
I do not know, go ask your dad.
Some are thin, and some are fat.
The fat one has a yellow hat.
From there to here,
From here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
Here are some who like to run.
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.
Oh me! Oh my! Oh me! oh my!
What a lot of funny things go by.
Some have two feet and some have four.
Some have six feet and some have more.
Where do they come from? I can't say.
But I bet they have come a long, long way.
we see them come, we see them go.
Some are fast. Some are slow.
Some are high. Some are low.
Not one of them is like another.
Don't ask us why, go ask your mother.

Say! Look at his fingers!
One, two, three...
How many fingers do I see?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He has eleven!
Eleven! This is something new.
I wish I had eleven too!

Bump! Bump! Bump!
Did you ever ride a Wump?
We have a Wump with just one hump.
But we know a man called Mr. Gump.
Mr. gump has a seven hump Wump. So...
If you like to go Bump! Bump!
Just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump

Who am I? My name is Ned
I do not like my little bed.
This is no good. This is not right.
My feet stick out of bed all night.
And when I pull them in, Oh, Dear!
My head sticks out of bed up here!

We like our bike. It is made for three.
Our Mike sits up in back, you see.
We like our Mike, and this is why:
Mike does all the work when the hills get high.

Hello there, Ned. How do you do?
Tell me, tell me what is new?
How are things in your little bed?
What is new? Please tell me Ned.
I do not like this bed at all.
a lot of things have come to call.
A cow, a dog, a cat, a mouse.
Oh! What a bed! Oh! What a house!

Oh dear, oh dear! I cannot hear.
Will you please come over near?
Will you please look in my ear?
There must be something there, I fear.
Say look! A bird was in your ear.
But he is out. So have no fear.
Again your ear can hear, my dear.

My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
And now my story is all told.

We took a look. We saw a Nook.
On his head he had a hook.
On his hook he had a book.
On his book was "How to Cook"
We saw him sit and try to cook
But a Nook can't read, so a Nook can't Cook.
SO...
What good to a Nook is a hook cook book?

the moon was out and we saw some sheep.
We saw some sheep take a walk in their sleep.
by the light of the moon, by the light of a star;
They walked all night from near to far.
I would never walk. I would take a car.

I do not like this one so well.
all he does is yell, yell, yell.
I will not have this one about.
When he comes in I put him out.
This one is quiet as a mouse.
I like to have him in the house.

At our house we open cans.
We have to open many cans.
and that is why we have a Zans.
A Zans for cans is very good.
Have you a Zans for cans? You should.

I like to box. How I like to box.
So every day I box a Gox.
In yellow socks I box my Gox.
I box in yellow Gox box socks.

It is fun to sing if you sing with a Ying.
My Ying can sing like anything.
I sing high and my Ying sings low.
And we are not too bad, you know.

this one, I think, is called a Yink.
he likes to wink, he likes to drink.
He likes to drink, and drink, and drink.
the thing he likes to drink is ink.
The ink he likes to drink is pink.
He likes to wink and drink pink ink.
SO...
If you have a lot of ink,
you should get a Yink, I think.

Hop, hop, hop! I am a Yop
All I like to do is hop,
From finger top to finger top.
I hop from left to right and then...
Hop, hop! I hop right back again.
I like to hop all day and night.
From right to left and left to right.
Why do I like to hop, hop, hop?
I do not know. Go ask your Pop.

Brush, brush, brush, brush
Comb, comb, comb, comb
Blue hair is fun to brush and comb.
All girls who like to brush and comb,
Should have a pet like this at home.

Who is this pet? Say! He is wet.
You never yet met a pet, I bet,
As wet as they let this wet pet get.

Did you ever fly a kite in bed?
did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?
Did you ever milk this kind of cow?
Well, we can do it. We know how.
If you never did, you should.
These things are fun, and fun is good.

Hello, hello. Are you there?
Hello! I called you up to say hello.
I said Hello.
Can you hear me, Joe?
Oh no, I cannot hear your call.
I cannot hear your call at all.
This is not good, and I know why.
A mouse has cut the wire, goodbye!

From near to far, from here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
These yellow pets are called the Zeds.
They have one hair upon their heads.
Their hair grows fast. So fast they say,
They need a haircut every day.

Who am I? My name is Ish
On my hand I have a dish.
I have this dish to help me wish.
When I wish to make a wish
I wave my hand with a big swish swish.
Then I say, "I wish for fish!"
And I get fish right on my dish.
So...
If you wish to make a wish,
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish.

At our house we play out back.
We play a game called ring the Gack.
Would you like to play this game?
Come down! We have the only Gack in town.

Look what we found in the park in the dark.
We will take him home, we will call him Clark.
He will live at our house, he will grow and grow.
Will our mother like this? We don't know.

And now, Good night.
It is time to sleep
So we will sleep with our pet Zeep.
Today is gone. Today was fun.
Tomorrow is another one.
Every day, from here to there.
funny things are everywhere.

Yertle the Turtle
-----------------

by dr. seuss

On the far-away island of Sala-ma-Sond,
Yertle the Turtle was king of the pond.
A nice little pond.  It was clean.  It was neat.
The water was warm.  There was plenty to eat.
The turtles had everything turtles might need.
And they were all happy.  Quite happy indeed.

They were... untill Yertle, the king of them all,
Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small.
"I'm ruler", said Yertle, "of all that I see.
But I don't see enough.  That's the trouble with me.
With this stone for a throne, I look down on my pond
But I cannot look down on the places beyond.
This throne that I sit on is too, too low down.
It ought to be higher!" he said with a frown.
"If I could sit high, how much greater I'd be!
What a king! I'd be ruler of all that I see!"

So Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand
And Yertle, the Turtle King, gave a command.
He ordered nine turtles to swim to his stone
And, using these turtles, he built a new throne.
He made each turtle stand on another one's back
And he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack.
And then Yertle climbed up.  He sat down on the pile.
What a wonderful view! He could see 'most a mile!

"All mine!" Yertle cried.  "Oh, the things I now rule!
I'm the king of a cow! And I'm the king of a mule!
I'm the king of a house! And, what's more, beyond that
I'm the king of a blueberry bush and a cat!
I'm Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!
For I am the ruler of all that I see!"

And all through the morning, he sat up there high
Saying over and over, "A grat king am I!"
Until 'long about noon.  Then he heard a faint sigh.
"What's that?" snapped the king
And he looked down the stack.
And he saw, at the bottom, a turtle named Mack.
Just a part of his throne.  And this plain little turtle
Looked up and he said, "Beg your pardon, King Yertle.
I've pains in my back and my shoulders and knees.
How long must we stand here, Your Majesty, please?"

"SILENCE!" the King of the Turtles barked back.
"I'm king, and you're only a turtle named Mack."

"You stay in your place while I sit here and rule.
I'm the king of a cow! And I'm the king of a mule!
I'm the king of a house! And a bush! And a cat!
But that isn't all.  I'll do better than that!
My throne shall be higher!" his royal voice thundered,
"So pile up more turtles! I want 'bout two hundred!"

"Turtles! More turtles!" he bellowed and brayed.
And the turtles 'way down in the pond were afraid.
They trembled.  They shook.  But they came.  They obeyed.
>From all over the pond, they came swimming by dozens.
Whole families of turtles, with uncles and cousins.
And all of them stepped on the head of poor Mack.
One after another, they climbed up the stack.

Then Yertle the Turtle was perched up so high,
He could see fourty miles from his throne in the sky!
"Hooray!" shouted Yertle.  "I'm the king of the trees!
I'm king of the birds! And I'm king of the bees!
I'm king of the butterflies! King of the air!
Ah, me! What a throne! What a wonderful chair!
I'm Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!
For I am the ruler of all that I see!"

Then again, from below, in the great heavy stack,
Came a groan from that plain little turtle named Mack.
"Your Majesty, please... I don't like to complain,
But down here below, we are feeling great pain.
I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,
But down here at the bottom we, too, should have rights.
We turtles can't stand it.  Our shells will all crack!
Besides, we need food.  We are starving!" groaned Mack.

"You hush up your mouth!" howled the mighty King Yertle.
"You've no right to talk to the world's highest turtle.
I rule from the clouds! Over land! Over sea!
There's nothing, no, NOTHING, that's higher than me!"

But, while he was shouting, he saw with suprise
That the moon of the evening was starting to rise
Up over his head in the darkening skies.
"What's THAT?" snorted Yertle.  "Say, what IS that thing
That dares to be higher than Yertle the King?
I shall not allow it! I'll go higher still!
I'll build my throne higher! I can and I will!
I'll call some more turtles.  I'll stack 'em to heaven!
I need 'bout five thousand, six hundred and seven!"

But, as Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand
And started to order and give the command,
That plain little turtle below in the stack,
That plain little turtle whose name was just Mack,
Decided he'd taken enough.  And he had.
And that plain little lad got a bit mad.
And that plain little Mack did a plain little thing.
He burped!
And his burp shook the throne of the king!

And Yertle the Turtle, the king of the trees,
The king of the air and the birds and the bees,
The king of a house and a cow and a mule...
Well, that was the end of the Turtle King's rule!
For Yertle, the King of all Sala-ma-Sond,
Fell off his high throne and fell Plunk! in the pond!

And tosay the great Yertle, that Marvelous he,
Is King of the Mud.  That is all he can see.
And the turtles, of course... all the turtles are free
As turtles and, maybe, all creatures should be.

Oh, the Places You'll Go!

by

Dr. Seuss


Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself 
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.

You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet, 
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.

And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.

It's opener there
in the wide open air.

Out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you.

And then things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.

OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!

You'll be on y our way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights.

You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.

Except when you don't.
Because, sometimes, you won't.

I'm sorry to say so
but, sadly, it's true
that Bang-ups
and Hang-ups
can happen to you.

You can get all hung up
in a prickle-ly perch.
And your gang will fly on.
You'll be left in a Lurch.

You'll come down from the Lurch
with an unpleasant bump.
And the chances are, then,
that you'll be in a Slump.

And when you're in a Slump,
you're not in for much fun.
Un-slumping yourself
is not easily done.

You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.
A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much can you lose? How much can you win?

And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
The Waiting Place...

...for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.

NO!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying
You'll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.

With banner flip-flapping,
once more you'll ride high!
Ready for anything under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.

Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.

I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.

All Alone!
Whether you like it or not,
Alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot.

And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.

But on you will go
though the weather be foul.
On you will go
though your enemies prowl.
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.

On and on you will hike,
And I know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.

You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up 
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's 
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never foget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.

And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!
(98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)

KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!

So...
be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray
or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,
You're off the Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting.
So...get on your way!

"The Sneetches"
by Dr. Seuss

Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches
Had bellies with stars.
The Plain-Belly Sneetches
Had none upon thars.

Those stars weren't so big.  They were really so small
You might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all.

But, because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches
Would brag, "We're the best kind of Sneetch on the Beaches."
With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they'd snort
"We'll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!"
And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,
They'd hike right on past them without even talking.

When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,
Could a Plain Belly get in the game... ? Not at all.
You only could play if your bellies had stars.
And the Plain Belly children had none upon thars.

When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts
Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,
They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.
They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.
They kept them away.  Never let them come near.
And that's how they treated them year after year.

Then ONE day, it seems... while the Plain-Belly Sneetches
Were moping and doping alone on the beaches,
Just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars... 
A stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars!

"My friends," he announced in a voice clear and keen,
"My name is Sylvester McMonkey McBean.
And I've heard of your troubles.  I've heard you're unhappy.
But I can fix that.  I'm the Fix-it-Up Chappie.
I've come here to help you.  I have what you need.
And my prices are low.  And I work at great speed.
And my work is one hundred percent guaranteed!"

Then, quickly Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Put together a very peculiar machine.
And he said, "You want stars like a Star-Belly Sneetch... ?
My friends, you can have them for three dollars each!"

"Just pay me your money and hop right aboard!"
So they clambered inside.  Then the big machine roared
And it klonked.  And it bonked.  And it jerked.  And it berked.
And it bopped them about. But the thing really worked!
When the Plain-Belly Sneetches popped out, they had stars!
They actually did.  They had stars upon thars!

Then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start,
"We're exactly like you! You can't tell us apart.
We're all just the same, now, you snooty old smarties!
And now we can go to your frankfurter parties."

"Good grief!" groaned the ones who had stars at the first.
"We're still the best Sneetches and they are the worst.
But, now, how in the world will we know," they all frowned,
"If which kind is what, or the other way round?"

Then up came McBean with a very sly wink
And he said, "Things are not quite as bad as you think.
So you don't know who's who. That is perfectly true.
But come with me, friends.  Do you know what I'll do?
I'll make you, again, the best Sneetches on the beaches
And all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches."

"Belly stars are no longer in style," said McBean.
"What you need is a trip through my Star-Off Machine.
This wondrous contraption will take off your stars
So you won't look like Sneetches who have them on thars."
And that handy machine
Working very precisely
Removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely.

Then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about
And they opened their beaks and they let out a shout,
"We know who is who! Now there isn't a doubt.
The best kind of Sneetches are Sneetches without!"

Then, of course, those with stars got frightfully mad.
To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.
Then, of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean
Invited them into his Star-Off Machine.

Then, of course from THEN on, as you probably guess,
Things really got into a horrible mess.

All the rest of that day, on those wild screaming beaches,
The Fix-it-Up Chappie kept fixing up Sneetches.
Off again!  On again!
In again! Out again!
Through the machines they raced round and about again,
Changing their stars every minute or two.
They kept paying money.  They kept running through
Until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew
Whether this one was that one... or that one was this one
Or which one was what one... of what one was who.

Then, when every last cent
Of their money was spent,
The Fix-it-Up Chappie packed up
And he went.

And he laughed as he drove
In his car up the beach,
"They never will learn.
No. You can't teach a Sneetch!"

But McBean was quite wrong.  I'm quite happy to say
That the Sneetches got really quite smart on that day,
The day they decided that Sneetches are Sneetches
And no kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches.
That day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars
And whether they had one, or not, upon thars.

Do, sir.

Mr. Fox, sir,

I can't say such silly stuff, sir.

Very well, then, Mr. Knox, sir.

Let's have a little talk about tweetle beetles....

What do you know about tweetle beetles?  Well...

When tweetle beetles fight, 
it's called a tweetle beetle battle.

And when they battle in a puddle, 
it's a tweetle beetle puddle battle.

AND when tweetle beetles battle with paddles in a puddle, 
they call it a tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle.

AND...

When beetles battle beetles in a puddle paddle battle 
and the beetle battle puddle is a puddle in a bottle...
...they call this a tweetle beetle bottle puddle paddle battle muddle.

AND...

When beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles 
and the bottle's on a poodle and the poodle's eating noodles...
...they call this a muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle 
bottle paddle battle.

AND...

Now wait a minute, Mr. Socks Fox!

When a fox is in the bottle where the tweetle beetles battle 
with their paddles in a puddle on a noodle-eating poodle, 
THIS is what they call...

...a tweetle beetle noodle poodle bottled paddled 
muddled duddled fuddled wuddled fox in socks, sir!

Fox in socks, our game is done, sir.
Thank you for a lot of fun, sir.

THE LORAX ~Dr. Seuss
At the far end of town
where the Grickle-grass grows
and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows
and no birds ever sing excepting old crows...
is the Street of the Lifted Lorax.
And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say,
if you look deep enough you can still see, today,
where the Lorax once stood
just as long as it could
before somebody lifted the Lorax away.
What was the Lorax?
And why was it there?
And why was it lifted and taken somewhere
from the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows?
The old Once-ler still lives here.
Ask him. He knows.
You won't see the Once-ler.
Don't knock at his door.
He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store.
He lurks in his Lerkim, cold under the roof,
where he makes his own clothes
out of miff-muffered moof.
And on special dank midnights in August,
he peeks
out of the shutters
and sometimes he speaks
and tells how the Lorax was lifted away.
He'll tell you, perhaps...
if you're willing to pay.
On the end of a rope
he lets down a tin pail
and you have to toss in fifteen cents
and a nail
and the shell of a great-great-greatgrandfather
snail.
Then he pulls up the pail,
makes a most careful count
to see if you've paid him
the proper amount.
Then he hides what you paid him
away in his Snuvv,
his secret strange hole
in his gruvvulous glove.
Then he grunts, "I will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone,
for the secrets I tell you are for your ears alone." 
SLUPP!
Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear
and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear,
since they have to come down
through a snergelly hose,
and he sounds
as if he had
smallish bees up his nose.
"Now I'll tell you,"he says, with his teeth sounding gray,
"how the Lorax got lifted and taken away...
It all started way back...
such a long, long time back...
Way back in the days when the grass was still green
and the pond was still wet
and the clouds were still clean,
and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space...
one morning, I came to this glorious place.
And I first saw the trees!
The Truffula Trees!
The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees!
Mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze.
And, under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots
frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits
as they played in the shade and ate Truffula fruits.
From the rippulous pond
came the comfortable sound
of the Humming-Fish humming
while splashing around.
But those trees! Those trees!
Those Truffula Trees!
All my life I'd been searching
for trees such as these.
The touch of their tufts
was much softer than silk.
And they had the sweet smell
of fresh butterfly milk.
I felt a great leaping
of joy in my heart.
I knew just what I'd do!
I unloaded my cart.
In no time at all, I had built a small shop.
Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop.
And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed,
I took the soft tuft, and I knitted a Thneed!
The instant I'd finished, I heard a ga-Zump!
I looked.
I saw something pop out of the stump 
of the tree I'd chopped down. It was sort of a man.
Describe him?... That's hard. I don't know if I can.
He was shortish. And oldish.
And brownish. And mossy.
And he spoke with a voice
that was sharpish and bossy.
"Mister!" he said with a sawdusty sneeze,
"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.
I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.
And I'm asking you, sir, at the top if my lungs"-
he was very upset as he shouted and puffed-
"What's that THING you've made out of my Truffula tuft?"
"Look, Lorax," I said."There's no cause for alarm.
I chopped just one tree. I am doing no harm.
I'm being quite useful. This thing is a Thneed.
A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!
It's a shirt. It's a sock. It's a glove, It's a hat.
But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that.
You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!
Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats!"
The Lorax said,
"Sir! You are crazy with greed.
There is no one on earth
who would buy that fool Thneed!"
But the very next minute I proved he was wrong.
For, just at that minute, a chap came along,
and he thought the Thneed I had knitted was great.
He happily bought it for three ninety-eight
I laughed at the Lorax, "You poor stupid guy!
You never can tell what some people will buy."
"I repeat," cried the Lorax,
"I speak for the trees!"
"I'm busy," I told him.
"Shut up, if you please."
I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all,
built a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.
I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts
and I said, "Listen here! Here's a wonderful chance
for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich!
Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch.
Turn left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South Stitch."
And, in no time at all,
in the factory I built,
the whole Once-ler Family
was working full tilt.
We were all knitting Thneeds
just as busy as bees, 
to the sound of the chopping
of Truffula Trees.
Then...
Oh! Baby! Oh!
How my business did grow!
Now, chopping one tree
at a time
was too slow.
So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker
which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker.
We were making Thneeds
four times as fast as before!
And that Lorax?...
He didn't show up any more.
But the next week
he knocked
on my new office door.
He snapped, "I am the Lorax who speaks for the trees
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please.
But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots
who played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits
and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits.
"NOW... thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground,
there's not enought Truffula Fruit to go 'round.
And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies
because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!
"They loved living here. But I can't let them stay.
They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may.
Good luck, boys," he cried. And he sent them away.
I, the old Once-ler, felt sad
as I watched them all go.
BUT...
business is business!
And business must grow
regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.
I meant no harm. I most truly did not.
But I had to grow bigger.So bigger I got.
I biggered my factory. I biggered my roads.
I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads
of the Thneeds I shipped out. I was shipping them forth
to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North!
I went right on biggering... selling more Thneeds.
And I biggered my money, which everyone needs.
Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes
when that old-nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.
"I am the Lorax," he coughed and he whiffed.
He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed. 
"Once-ler!" he cried with a cruffulous croak.
"Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!
My poor Swomee-Swans... why, they can't sing a note!
No one can sing who has smog in his throat.
"And so," said the Lorax,
"-please pardon my coughthey
cannot live here.
So I'm sending them off.
"Where will they go?...
I don't hopefully know.
They may have to fly for a month... or a year...
To escape from the smog you've smogged up around here.
"What's more," snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.)
"Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp.
Your machine chugs on, day and night without stop
making Gluppity-Glupp. Also Schloppity-Schlopp.
And what do you do with this leftover goo?...
I'll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!
"You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed!
No more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed.
So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary.
They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary
in search of some water that isn't so smeary."
And then I got mad.
I got terribly mad.
I yelled at the Lorax, "Now listen here, Dad!
All you do is yap-yap and say, 'Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!'
Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you
I intend to go on doing just what I do!
And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering
On biggering
and BIGGERING
andBIGGERING
and BIGGERING,
turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneeds
which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE needs!"
And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack!
From outside in the fields came a sickening smack
of an axe on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall.
The very last Truffula Tree of them all!
No more trees. No more Thneeds. No more work to be done.
So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one,
all waved me good-bye. They jumped into my cars
and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars. 
Now all that was left 'neath the bad smelling-sky
was my big empty factory...
the Lorax...
and I.
The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance...
just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance...
as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants.
And I'll never forget the grim look on his face
when he heisted himself and took leave of this place,
through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace.
And all that the Lorax left here in this mess
was a small pile of rocks, with one word...
"UNLESS."
Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.
That was long, long ago.
But each day since that day
I've sat here and worried
and worried away.
Through the years, while my buildings
have fallen apart,
I've worried about it
with all of my heart.
"But now," says the Once-ler,
"Now that you're here,
the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear.
UNLESS someone like you
cares a whole awful lot,
nothing is going to get better.
It's not.
"SO...
Catch!" calls the Once-ler.
He lets something fall.
"It's a Truffula Seed.
It's the last one of all!
You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds.
And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs.
Plant a new Truffula.Treat it with care.
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.
Then the Lorax
and all of his friends
may come back." 

And To Think I saw it on Mulberry Street. By: Dr.Seuss
When I leave home to walk to school,
Dad always says to me,
?Marco, keep your eyelids up
And see what you can see.?
But when I tell him where I've been
And what I think I've seen,
He looks at me and sternly says,
?Your eyesight's much too keen.?
?Stop telling such outlandish tales.
Stop turning minnows into whales.?
Now, what can I say
when I get home today?
All the long way to school
And all the way back,
I've looked and I've looked
And I've kept careful track.
But all that I've noticed, Except my own feet
Was a horse and a wagon on Mulberry Street.
That's nothing to tell of,
That won't do, of course....
Just a broken-down wagon
That's drawn by a horse.
That can't be my story. That's only a start.
I'll say that a ZEBRA was pulling that cart!
And that is a story that no one can beat,
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street.
Yes, the zebra is fine,
But I think it's a shame,
Such a marvelous beast
With a cart that's so tame.
The story would really be better to hear
If the driver I saw there were a charioteer.
A gold and blue chariot's something to meet,
Rumbling like thunder down Mulberry Street.
No, it won't do at all... a zebra's too small.
A reindeer is better; he's fast and he's fleet,
And he'd look mighty smart
On old Mulberry Street.
Hold on a minute! There's something wrong!
A reindeer hates the way it feels
To pull a thing that runs on wheels.
He'd be much happier, instead,
If he could pull a fancy sled.
Hmmm.. A reindeer and a sleigh..
Say-anyone could think of that,
Jack or Fred of Joe or Nat--
Say, even Jane could think of that.
But it isn't too late to make one little change.
A sleigh and an ELEPHANT!
There's something strange!
Say! That makes a story that no one can beat,
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street.
But now I don't know... It still doesn't seem right.
An elephant pulling a think that's so light
Would whip it around in the air like a kite.
But he'd look simply grand
With a great big brass band!
A band that's so good should have someone to hear it,
But it's going so fast that it's hard to keep near it.
I'll put on a trailer! I know they won't mind
If a man sits and listens while hitched on behind.
But now is it fair? Is it fair what I've done?
I'll bet those wagons weigh more than a ton.
That's really too heavy a load for one beast;
I'll give him some helpers. He needs two, at least.
But now what worries me is this..
Mulberry Street runs into Bliss.
Unless there's something I can fix up,
There'll be an awful traffic mix-up!
It takes Police to do the trick,
To guide them through where traffic's thick ?
It takes Police to do the trick.
They'll never crash now, They'll race at top speed.
With Sergeant Mulvaney, himself, in the lead.
The Mayor is there, And he thinks it is grand,
And he raises his hat as they dash by the stand.
The Mayor is there and the Aldermen too,
All waving big banners of red, white and blue.
And that is a story that NO ONE can beat
When I say that I saw it on Mulberry Street!
With a roar of its motor an airplane appears
And dumps out confetti while everyone cheers
And that makes a story that's really not bad!
But it still could be better. Suppose that I add...
A Chinaman who eats with sticks...
A big Magician doing tricks..
A ten-foot beard that needs a comb...
No time for more, I'm almost home.
I swung 'round the corner and dashed through the gate, I
ran up the steps and I felt simply GREAT!
For I had a story that NO ONE could beat!
And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street!
But Dad said quite calmly,
?just draw up your stool?
and tell me the sights on
the way home from school? There was so much to tell, I
JUST COULDN'T BEGIN! Dad looked at me sharply
and pulled at his chin.
He frowned at me sternly from there in his seat, ?was
there nothing to look at..No people to greet?
Did nothing excite you or make your heart beat??
?Nothing,? I said, growing read as a beet,
?But a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street.? 

IN THE beginning, Bartholomew Cubbins didn't have five hundred hats. 
He had only one hat. It was an old one that had belonged to his father and 
his father's father before him. It was probably the oldest and the plainest hat 
in the whole Kingdom of Didd, where Bartholomew Cubbins lived. But 
Bartholomew liked it - especially because of the feather that always pointed 
straight up in the air. 



The Kingdom of Didd was ruled by King 
Derwin. His palace stood high on the top of the 
mountain. From his balcony, he looked down over 
the houses of all his subjects - first, over the spires 
of the noblemen's castles, across the broad roofs 
of the rich men's mansions, then over the little 
houses of the townsfolk, to the huts of the farmers 
far off in the fields. 

It was a mighty view and it made King Derwin 
feel mighty important. 





Far off in the fields, on the edge of a cranberry bog, stood the hut of the Cubbins family. From the small door 
Bartholomew looked across the huts of the farmers to the houses of the townsfolk, then to the rich men's mansions and 
the noblemen's castles, up to the great towering palace of the King. It was exactly the same view that King Derwin saw 
from his balcony, but Bartholomew saw it backward. 

It was a mighty view, but it made Bartholomew Cubbins feel mighty small. 




I 



Just after sunrise one Saturday 
morning Bartholomew started for 
town. He felt very happy. A pleasant 
breeze whistled through the feather in 
his hat. In his right hand he carried a 
basket of cranberries to sell at the 
market. He was anxious to sell them 
quickly and bring the money back 
home to his parents. 

He walked faster and faster till he 
got to the gates of the town. 


The sound of silver trumpets rang 
through the air. Hoof beats clattered 
on the cobbled streets. 

"Clear the way! Clear the way! 
Make way for the King ! " 




All the people rushed for the pavements. They drove their carts right up over the kerbstones. Bartholomew 
clutched his basket tighter. 

Around the comer dashed fifty trumpeters on yellow-robed horses. Behind them on crimson-robed horses 
came the King's Own Guards. 

"Hats off to the King!" shouted the Captain of the King's Own Guards. 

On came the King's carriage - white and gold and purple. It rumbled like thunder through the narrow 
street. 

It swept past Bartholomew. Then suddenly its mighty brakes shrieked. It lurched - and then it stopped. 
The whole procession stood still. 

Bartholomew could hardly believe what he saw. Through the side window of the carriage, the King himself 
was staring back - straight back at him! Bartholomew began to tremble. 

"Back up ! " the King commanded the Royal Coachman. 

The Royal Coachman shouted to the royal horses. The King's Own Guards shouted to their crimson- 
robed horses. The trumpeters shouted to their yellow-robed horses. Very slowly the whole procession backed 
down the street, until the King's carriage stopped right in front of Bartholomew. 



The King leaned from his carriage window and fixed his eyes directly on Bartholomew Cubbins. "Well. . .? 
Well...?" he demanded. 

Bartholomew shook with fright. "I ought to say something," he thought to himself. But he could think of 
nothing to say. 

"Well?" demanded the King again. "Do you or do you not take off your hat before your King?" 

"Yes, indeed, Sire," answered Bartholomew, feeling greatly relieved. "I do take off my hat before my 
King." 

"Then take it off this very instant," commanded the King more loudly than before. 

"But, Sire, my hat is off," answered Bartholomew. 

"Such impudence!" shouted the King, shaking an angry finger. "How dare you stand there and tell me 
your hat is off!" 

"I don't like to say you are wrong, Sire," said Bartholomew very politely, "but you sec my hat is off." And 
he showed the King the hat in his hand. 

"If that's your hat in your hand," demanded the King, "what's that on your head?" 

"On my head?" gasped Bartholomew. There did seem to be something on his head. He reached up his 
hand and touched a hat! 



The face of Bartholomew Cubbins turned very red. 'It's a hat, Sire," he stammered, "but it can 't 
be mine. Someone behind me must have put it on my head." 

"I don't care how it got there," said the King. "You take it off." And the King sat back in his 
carriage. 

Bartholomew quickly snatched off the hat. He stared at it in astonishment. It was exactly the same 
as his own hat - the same size, the same colour. And it had exactly the same feather. 

' 'By the Crown of my Fathers!" roared the King, again leaning out of the carriage window. "Did 
I or did I not command you to take off your hat?" 

"You did, Sire. ... I took it off... I took it off twice." 

"Nonsense ! There is still a hat upon your head." 

"Another hat?" Again Bartholomew reached up his hand and touched a hat. 

"Come, come, what is the meaning of all this?" demanded the King, his face purple with rage. 

"I don't know, Sire," answered Bartholomew. "It never happened to me before." 

The King was now shaking with such fury that the carriage rocked on its wheels and the Royal 
Coachman could hardly sit in his seat. "Arrest this impudent trickster," shouted the King to the Captain 
of the King's Own Guards. "We'll teach him to take offhis hat." 



The Royal Coachman cracked his long whip. The King's carriage swung 
forward up the street toward the palace. 

But the Captain of the King's Own Guards leaned down from his big brass 
saddle and grabbed Bartholomew Cubbins by his shirt. Away flew 
Bartholomew's basket! The cranberries bounced over the cobblestones and 
rolled down into the gutter. 

With a jangling of spurs and a clatter of hotseshoes, the Captain and 
Bartholomew sped up the winding street toward the palace. Out of the narrow 
streets, on up the hill! Bartholomew clung to the Captain's broad back. On and 
on they galloped, past the bright gardens of the wealthy merchants. Higher and 
higher up the mountain, on past the walls of the noblemen's castles. .. . 



Flupp !.... the sharp wind whisked olf Bartholomew's hat. Flupp Flupp .... two more flew off. Flupp 
Flupp Flupp flew another . . . and another. "... 4 ... 5 .. - 6 . .. 7 ..." Bartholomew kept counting as the 
hats came faster and faster. Lords and ladies stared from the windows of their turrets, wondering what 
the strange stream of hats could mean. 

Over the palace drawbridge they sped - through the great gates, and into the courtyard. The Captain 
pulled in his reins. 

"His Majesty waits in the Throne Room," said a guard, saluting the Captain. 

"The Throne Room! " The Captain dropped Bartholomew to the ground. "I'd certainly hate to be in 
your shoes," he said, shaking his head sadly. 

For a moment Bartholomew was terribly frightened. "Still," he thought to himself, "the King can do 
nothing dreadful to punish me, because I really haven't done anything wrong. It would be cowardly to 
feel afraid." 

Bartholomew threw back his shoulders and marched straight ahead into the palace. "Follow the 
black carpet," said the guard at the door. All through the long hallway Bartholomew could hear the 
muttering of voices behind heavy doors. "He won't take off his hat?" "No, he won't take off his hat." 



Bartholomew walked on till he stood 
in the very middle of the Throne Room. 

The King, in a long scarlet robe, was sitting on 
his throne. Beside him stood Sir Aiaric, Keeper of 
the King's Records. He wore in his belt, instead of a 
sword, a long silver ruler. Lords and noblemen of the 
court stood solemn and silent. 

The King looked down at Bartholomew severely. "Young man, I'll give you one 
more chance. Will you take off your hat for your King?" 

"Your Majesty," said Bartholomew as politely as he possibly could, "I will - but 
I'm afraid it won't do any good." And he took offhis hat - and it didn't do any good. 
Another hat sat on Bartholomew's head. He took off hat after hat after hat after hat 
until he was standing in the middle of a great pile of hats. 

The lords and noblemen were so astonished they couldn't even speak. Such a thing 
had never happened in the Throne Room before. 



"Heavens!" said Sir Alaric, Keeper of the Records, 
blinking behind his triangular spectacles. "He's taken off 
45!" 

"And there were 3 more down in the town," said the 
King. 

"And you must add on 87 more that blew off my head 
as we galloped up the hill," said Bartholomew, trying to 
be helpful. 

"One hundred and thirty-five hats ! Most unusual," said 
Sir Alaric, writing it down on a long scroll. 

"Come, come," said the King impatiently. "Sir Alaric, 
what do you make of all this nonsense?" 

"Very serious nonsense, Your Maj esty," answered Sir 
Alaric. "I advise you to call in an expert on hats." 

"Excellent," agreed the King. "Ho, Guard! Fetch in 
Sir Snipps, maker of hats for all the fine lords." 


Into the Throne Room marched the smallest man, 
wearing the tallest hat that Bartholomew had ever seen. It 
was Sir Snipps. Instead of a sword, he wore at his side a 
large pair of scissors. 

"Take a look at this boy's hat," commanded the King. 
Sir Snipps looked at Bartholomew Cubbins' hat and 
sniffed in disgust. Then he turned to the King and bowed 
stiffly. "Your Majesty, I, Sir Snipps, am the maker of hats 
for all the fine lords. I make hats of cloth of gold, fine si lks 
and gems and ostrich plumes. You ask me what I think of 
this hat? Pooh! It is the most ordinary hat I ever set eyes 
on." 

"In that case," said the King, "it should be very simple 
for you to take it off." 

"Simple, indeed," mumbled Sir Snipps haughtily, and, 
standing on his tiptoes, he pushed his pudgy thumb at 
Bartholomew's hat and knocked it to the floor. 
Immediately another appeared on Bartholomew's head. 




"Screebees! " screamed Sir Snipps, leaping in the air higher than he is tall. Then he turned and ran shrieking 
out of the Throne Room. 



"Dear me! " said the King, looking very puzzled. "If 
Snipps can't doit, this must be more than an ordinary 
hat." 

"One hundred and thirty-six," wrote Sir Alaric wrinkling 
his brow. "Your Majesty, I advise that you call 

in your Wise Men." 

"A fine idea!" said the King. "Ho, Guard! bring me 
Nadd. Nadd knows about everything in all my kingdom." 

In came an old, old man. He looked at the hat on 
Bartholomew's head, and he looked at the pile of hats on 
the floor. 

"Nadd, my Wise Man, can you take off his hat?" asked 
the King. Nadd shook his head solemnly - solemnly no. 



"Then fetch me the Father of Nadd," commanded the 
King. "He knows about everything in all my kingdom and 
in all the- world beyond." 


In came an even older man. But when he looked at 
Bartholomew's hats, the Father of Nadd merely locked 
his fingers across his beard and said nothing. 


'Then bring me the Father of the Father ofNadd!" ordered 
the 

King. "He knows about everything in all my kingdom, in all 
the world beyond, and in all other worlds that may happen to 
be." 

Then came the oldest man of them all. But he just looked at 
Bartholomew and nibbled nervously at the end of his beard. 

"Does this mean there is no one in my whole kingdom who 
can take off this boy's hat?" bellowed the King in a terrifying 
voice. 

A small voice came up through the balcony window. "What's 
the matter, Uncle Derwin?" To Bartholomew, it sounded like 
the voice of a boy. 

The King stepped out on the balcony and leaned over the 
marble railing. "There's aboy inhere ...just about your age," 
the King said. "He won't take off his hat." 


Bartholomew tiptoed up behind the King and looked 
down. There stood a boy with a big lace collar - a very 
proud little boy with his nose in the air. It was the Grand 
Duke Wilfred, nephew of the King. 

"You send him down here," said the Grand Duke Wilfred. 
" I'll fix him." 

The King thought for a minute. He pushed back his crown 
and scratched his head. "Well... Maybe you can. There's 
no hann in trying." 

"Take him to the Grand Duke Wilfred!" commanded 
the King. And two of the King's Own Guards led 
Bartholomew out of the Throne Room. 





"Pooh ! " said the Grand Duke Wilfred, looking at Bartholomew's hat and laughing meanly. " That 
hat won't tome off? You stand over there." He pointed to a comer where the wall curved out. "I 
need a little target practice with my bow and arrow." 



When Bartholomew saw that the Grand 
Duke Wi lfr ed had only a child's bow he didn't 
feel frightened. He spoke up proudly, "I can 
shoot with my father 's big bow." 

"My bow's quite big enough for shooting 
hats - especially hats like yours," answered 
Wilfred. And he let fly an arrow. zZZ! ... it 
grazed Bartholomew's forehead and nipped 
off his hat. Away it blew, and over the 
parapet. But another hat appeared on his 
head. zzZ ! . . . zzZ ! . . . zzZ ! ... the arrows flew 
... till the Grand Duke 's whole bagful of arrows 
was gone. And still a hat sat upon 
Bartholomew's head. 

"It's not fair," cried the Grand Duke. "It's 
not fair!" He threw down his bow and 
stamped upon it. 

"One hundred and fifty-four hats ! ' ' gulped 
SirAlaric. 



"These hats are driving me mad!" The King's voice rang out through all the palace. "Why 
waste time with a child s bow and arrow. Fetch me the mightiest bow and arrow in all my 
realm - fetch the Yeoman of the Bowmen!" 


"Yeoman of the Bowmen," echoed all the lords and noblemen of the court. 


A gigantic man strode out across the terrace. His bow was as big as the branch of a tree. The 
arrow was twice as long as Bartholomew, and thicker than his wrist. 


"Yeoman of the Bowmen," said the King, "shoot off this boy's hat... and make it stay off!" 


G - r - r-zibb !. . . Like a mad giant hornet 
the arrow tore through the air towards 
Bartholomew Cubbins. 

G - r - r - zapp/... The sharp arrow-head 
bit through his hat and carried it off - on and 
on for a full half mile. 

G~r - r - zoppf. . . It plunked to a stop in 
the heart of an oak tree. Yet there on 
Bartholomew's head sat another hat. 



Bartholomew was trembling so hard that he could scarcely stand straight. The Yeoman bent 
back his mighty bow. 





The face of the Yeoman of the Bowmen went as white as the palace walls. "It's black magic ! " he shrieked. 

"Black magic, that's just what it is," sighed the King with relief. "I should have thought of that before. That 
makes things simple. Back to the Throne Room! Call my magicians! " 

In the whole Throne Room there wasn't a sound as loud as a breath. But from the spiral stairs that led down 
from the southwest tower came the shuffling of slow, padded feet. The magicians were coming! Low and slow, 
they were chanting words that were strange . . . 

"Dig a hole five furlongs deep, 

Down to where the night makes creep, 

Mix and mould the mystic mud, 

Malber, Bather, Tidder, Tudd. " 

In came seven black-gowned magicians, and beside each one stalked a lean black cat. They circled around 
Bartholomew Cubbins muttering deep and mysterious sounds. 

"Stop this useless muttering," ordered the King. "I want a chant that will charm away this boy's hat." 

The magicians huddled over Bartholomew and chanted. 

"Winkibus 

Tinkibus 

Fotiches 

Klay, 

Hat on this demon s head, 

Fly far away! 

Howl, men, howl away, 

Howl away, howl away, 

Yowl, cats, yowl away, 

Yowl away, yowl away! 

Hat on this demon s head, 

Step away, creep away, leap away, gleap away, 

Never come back! " 


"A mighty good chant," said the King, looking very pleased. "Are you sure it will work?" 

All the magicians nodded together. 

"But," said the King, looking puzzled, "there still seems to be a hat upon his head. How long will it take for 
the chann to work?" 

" Be calm, oh. Sire, and hare no fears, " chanted the magicians. 

"Our charm will work in ten short years. " 

"Ten years'" gasped the King. "Away, fools!" he shouted. "Out of my sight! I can't wait ten years to get 
rid of his hat. Oh, dear, what can I do ... what can I do?" 

"If I were King," whispered the Grand Duke Wilfred, "I'd chop off his head." 

"A dreadful thought," said the King, biting his iip. "But I'm afraid I'll have to." 



"Young man," he said to Bartholomew Cubbins, and he pointed to a small door at the end of the 
room, "march down those steps to the dungeon and tell the executioner to chop off your head." 

Bartholomew's heart sank into his boots, but he did as the King commanded. "I must take off 
my hat," he said to himself as he started down the long black stairway. "This is my last chance." One 

hat after another he tore from his head "... 156... 157 ... 158 ..." It grew colder and damper. ". 
.. 217 ... 218 ... 219 ..." Down . . . down . . .down. "... 231 ... 232 ... 233.. ." It seemed to 
Bartholomew he must be in the very heart of the mountain. 

"Who's there?" said a voice from the blackness. 

Bartholomew turned a comer and stepped into the dungeon. 



The executioner was whistling and swinging his axe idly, because at the moment he had nothing to 
do. In spite of his business, he really seemed to be a very pleasant man. 

"The King says you must chop olf my head," said Bartholomew. "Oh, I'd hate to," said the executioner, 
looking at him with a friendly smile. "You seem such a nice boy." 

"Well ... the King says you have to," said Bartholomew, "so please get it over with." 

"All right," sighed the executioner, "but first you've got to take off your hat." 

"Why?" asked Bartholomew. 

"I don't know," said the executioner, "but it's one of the rules. I can't execute anyone with his hat 
on." 

"All right," said Bartholomew, "you take it off for me." 

The executioner leaned across the chopping block and flipped off Bartholomew's hat. 

"What's this?" he gasped, blinking through the holes in his mask, as another hat sat on Bartholomew's 
head. He flipped this one off... then another and another. 



"Fiddlesticks!" grunted the executioner, throwing his axe on the floor. "I can't execute you at all." And he 
shook hands with Bartholomew and sent him back upstairs to the King. 

The King had been taking a nap on the throne. "What are you doing back here?" he said to Bartholomew, 
angry at being awakened. 

"I'm sorry, Your Majesty," explained Bartholomew. "My head can't come off with my hat on. ... It's 
against the rules." 

"So it can't," said the King, leaning back wearily. "Now how many hats does that make altogether?" 

"The executioner knocked off 13... and I left 178 more on the dungeon steps," answered Bartholomew. 

"Three hundred and forty-six hats," mumbled Sir Alaric from behind his scroll. 

"Uncle Derwin," yawned the Grand Duke Wilfred, "I suppose I'll have to do away with him. Send him 
up to the highest turret and I, in person, will push him off." 

"Wilfred! I'm surprised at you," said the King. "But I guess it's a good idea." 

So the King and the Grand Duke led Bartholomew Cubbins toward the highest turret. 

Up and up and up the turret stairs he climbed behind them. 

"This is my last - my very last chance," thought Bartholomew. He snatched olThis hat. "Three hundred 
and forty-seven!" He snatched off another. He pulled and he tore and he flung them behind him. ". . .398 .. 
399 . . ." His arms ached from pulling off hats. But still the hats came. Bartholomew climbed on. 

".. . 448 . .. 449. . . 450 . . ." counted Sir Alaric, puffing up the stairs behind him. 



Suddenly Sir Alaric stopped. He looked. He took 
off his triangular spectacles and wiped them on his 
sleeve. And then he looked again. The hats began to 
change! Hat 45 1 had, not one, but two feathers! Hat 
452 had three . . . and 453 also had three and a little 
red jewel! Each new hat was fancier than the hat just 
before. 

"Your Majesty! Your Majesty !" cried out Sir Alaric. 

But the King and the Grand Duke were far up where 
they couldn't hear. They had akeady reached the top 
of the highest turret. Bartholomew was following just 
behind. 

"Step right out here and get out on that wall," 
snapped the Grand Duke Wilfred. "I can't wait to push 
you off." 



But when Bartholomew stepped up on the wall they gasped in amazement. He was wearing the most beautiful 
hat that had ever been seen in the Kingdom of Didd. It had a ruby larger than any the King himself had ever owned. 
It had ostrich plumes, and cockatoo plumes, and mockingbird plumes, and paradise plumes. Beside such a hat 
even the King's Crown seemed like nothing. 


The Grand Duke Wilfred took a quick step forward. Bartholomew thought his end had come at last. 


"Wait ! " shouted the King. He could not take his eyes off the magnificent hat. 


"I won 't wait," the Grand Duke talked back to the King. "I'm going to push him off now! That new big hat 
makes me madder than ever." And he flung out his arms to push Bartholomew off. 



But the King was quicker than Wilfred. He grabbed him by the back of his fine lace collar. 
"This is to teach you," His Majesty said sternly, "that Grand Dukes never talk back to their 
King." And he turned the Grand Duke Wilfred over his knee and spanked him soundly, right 
on the seat of his royal silk pants. 

"And now," smiled the King, lifting Bartholomew down from the wall, "it would be nice if 
you'd sell me that wonderful hat! " 

". . . 498 . . . -499 . . ." broke in the tired voice of Sir Alaric, who had just arrived at the 
top of the steps, "and that ..." he pointed to the hat on Bartholomew's head, "makes 
exactly 500!" 

"Five Hundred! " exclaimed the King. "Will you sell it for 500 pieces of gold?" 

"Anything you say, Sire," answered Bartholomew. "You see ... I've never sold one before." 

The King's hands trembled with joy as he reached for the hat. 

Slowly, slowly, Bartholomew felt the weight of the great hat lifting from his head. He held 
his breath. . . . Then suddenly he felt the cool evening breezes blow through his hair. His face 
broke into a happy smile. The head of Bartholomew Cubbins was bare! 


"Look, Your Majesty! Look! " he shouted to the King. 



"No! You look at me, " answered the King. And he put the great hat on right over his crown. 

Ann in arm, the King and Bartholomew went down to the counting room to count out the gold. Then the 
King sent Bartholomew home to his parents ... no basket on his arm, no hat on his head, but with five 
hundred pieces of gold in a bag. 

And the King commanded that the hat he had bought, and all the other hats, too, be kept forever in a 
great crystal case by the side of his throne. 

But neither Bartholomew Cubbins, nor King Dcrwin himself, nor anyone else in the Kingdom of Didd 
could ever explain how the strange thing had happened. They only could say it just "happened to happen" 
and was not very likely to happen again.

Sighed Mayzie, a lazy bird hatching an egg:
?I?m tired and I?m bored
And I?ve kinks in my leg
From sitting, just sitting here day after day.
It?s work! How I hate it!
I?d much rather play!
I?d takea vacation, fly off for a rest
If I could find someone to stay on my nest!
If I could find someone, I?d fly away-free??

Then Horton, the Elephant, passed by her tree.
?Hello!? called the lazy bird, smiling her best,
?You?ve nothing to do and I do need a rest.
Would you like to sit on the egg in my nest??

The elephant laughed.
?Why, of all silly things!
I haven?t feathers and I haven?t wings.
Me on your egg? Why, that doesn?t make sense?
Your egg is so small, ma?am, and I?m so immense!?
?Tut, tut,? answered Mayzie.  ?I know you?re not small
But I?m sure you can do it. No trouble at all.
Just sit on it softly. You?re gentle and kind.
Come, be a good fellow.  I know you won?t mind.?
?I can?t,? said the elephant
?PL-E-E-ASE!? begged the bird.
?I won?t be gone long, sir.  I give you my word.
I?ll hurry right back.  Why, I?ll never be missed?.?

?Very well,? said the elephant, ?since you insist?
You want a vacation.  Go fly off and take it.
I?ll sit on your egg and I?ll try not to break it.
I?ll stay and be faithful.  I mean what I say.?
?Toodle-oo!? sang out Mayzie and fluttered away.

?H-m-m-m..the first thing to do,? murmured Horton,
?Let?s see?
The first thing to do is to prop up this tree
And make it much stronger. That has to be done
Before I get on it. I must weigh a ton.?

Then carefully,
Tenderly,
Gently he crept
Up the trunk to the nest where the little egg slept.

Then Horton the elephant smiled.  ?Now that?s that??
And he sat
And he sat
And he sat
And he sat?.

And he sat all that day
And he kept the egg warm?
And he sat all that night
Through a terrible storm.
It poured and it lightninged!
It thundered! It rumbled!
?This isn?t much fun,?
The poor elephant grumbled.
?I wish she?d come back
?Cause I?m cold and I?m wet.
I hope that that Mayzie bird doesn?t forget.?

But Mayzie, by this time, was far beyond reach,
Enjoying the sunshine way off in the Palm Beach,
And having such fun, such a wonderful rest,
Decided she?d never go back to her nest!

So Horton kept sitting there, day after day.
And soon it was Autumn.  The leaves blew away.
And then came the Winter?the snow and the sleet!
And icicles hung
From his trunk and his feet.
But Horton kept sitting, and said with a sneeze,
?I?ll stay on this egg and I won?t let it freeze.
I meant what I said
And I said what I meant?
An elephant?s faithful
One hundred per cent!?

So poor Horton sat there
The whole winter through?
And then came the springtime
With troubles anew!
His friends gathered round
And they shouted with glee.

?Look! Horton the Elephant?s up in a tree!?
They taunted, they teased him,
 They yelled, ?How Absurd!?
?Old Horton the Elephant
Thinks hE?s a bird!?

They Laughed the they Laughed, Then they al ran away.
And Horton was lonely. He wanted to play
but he sat on the egg and continued to say
?I meant what I said
And I said what I meant?
An elephant?s faithful
One hundred per cent!

?No matter What happens,
This egg must be tended!?
But poor Horton?s troubles
Were far, far from ended
For, while Horton sat there
So faithful, so kind,
Three hunters came sneaking
Up softly behind!

He heard the men?s footsteps!
He turned with a start!
Three rifles were aiming
Right strait at his heart!

Did he run?
He did not!
HORTON STAYED ON THAT NEST!
He held his head high
And he threw out his chest
And he looked at the hunters
As much as to say:
?Shoot if you must
But I won?t run away!
I meant what I said
And I said what I meant?
An elephant?s faithful
One hundred per cent!?

But the men didn?t shoot!
Much to Horton?s surprise
They dropped their three guns
And they stared with wide eyes!
?look!? they all shouted,
?Can such a thing be?
An elephant sitting on top of a tree??

?It?s strange!  It?s amazing!  It?s wonderful!  New!
Don?t shoot him.  We?ll catch him.  That?s just what we?ll do!
Let?s take him alive.  Why, he?s terribly funny!
We?ll sell him back to a circus, for money!?

And the first thing he knew, they had built a big wagon
With ropes on the front for the pullers to drag on.
They dug up his tree and they put it inside,
With Horton so sad that he practically cried.
?we?re off!?  the men shouted.  And off they all went
With Horton unhappy, one hundred per cent.

Up out of the jungle!  Up into the sky!
Up over the mountains ten thousand feet high!
Then down, down the mountains
And down to the sea
Went the cart with the elephant,
Egg, nest and tree?

Then out of the wagon
And onto a ship!
Out over the ocean?
And ooh, what a trip!
Rolling and tossing and splashed with the spray!
And Horton said, day after day after day,
?I meant what I said
And I said what I meant?
But oh, am I seasick!
One hundred per cent!?

After bobbing around for two weeks like a cork,
They landed at last in the town of New York.
?All ashore!? the men shouted,
And down with a lurch
Went Horton the Elephant
Still on his perch,
Tied onto a board that could just scarcely hold him?
Bump!
Horton landed!
And then the men sold him!

Sold to a circus!  Then week after week
They showed him to people at ten cents a peek.
They took him to Boston, to Kalamazoo,
Chicago, Weehawken and Washington, too;
To Dayton, Ohio; St. Paul, Minnesota;
To Wichita, Kansas; to Drake, North Dakota.
And everywhere thousands of folks flocked to see
And laugh at the elephant up in a tree.
Poor Horton grew sadder the farther he went,
But he said as he sat in the hot noisy tent:
?I meant what I said, and I said what I meant?
An elephant?s faithful?one hundred per cent!?

Then?one day
The circus show happened to reach
A town way down south, not so far from Palm Beach.
And, dawdling along way up high in the sky,
Who (of all people!) should chance to fly by
But that old good-for-nothing bird, runaway Mayzie!
Still on vacation and still just as lazy.
And, spying the flags and the tents just below,
She sang out, ?What fun! Why, I?ll go to the show!?

And she swooped from the clouds
Through an open tent door?
?Good gracious!? gasped Mayzie,
?I?ve seen you before!?
Poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk!
He started to speak, but before he could talk?

There rang out the noisiest ear-splitting squeaks
From the egg that he?d sat on for fifty-one weeks!
A thumping! A Bumping! A wild alive scratching!
?My egg!?  Shouted Horton. ?My egg! Why, it?s hatching!?

?But it?s Mine!? screamed the bird, when she heard the egg crack.
(the work was all done. Now she wanted it back.)
?It?s my egg!? she sputtered.  ?You stole it from me!
Get off of my nest and get out of my tree!?
Poor Horton backed down
With a sad, heavy heart?

But at that very instant, the egg burst apart!
And out of the pieces of red and white shell,
From the egg that he?d sat on so long and so well,
Horton the Elephant saw something whizz!
It had Ears
And a Tail
And a trunk just like his!

And the people came shouting,  ?what?s all this about???
They looked! And they stared with their eyes popping out!
Then they cheered and they cheered and they cheered more and more.
They?d never seen anything like it before!
?My goodness! My gracious!? they shouted. ?My Word!
It?s something brand new!
It?s an elephant-bird!!
And it should be, it should be, it should be like that!
Because Horton was faithful!  He sat and he sat!
He meant what he said
And he said what he meant??

?And they sent him home
Happy,
One hundred per cent!

When you think things are bad,
when you feel sour and blue,
when you start to get mad?
you should do what I do!

Just tell yourself, Duckie,
you?re really quite lucky!
Some people are much more?
oh, ever so much more?
oh, muchly much-much more
unlucky than you!

Be glad you don?t work on the Bunglebung Bridge
that they?re building across Boober Bay at Bumm Ridge.

It?s a troublesome world. All the people who?re in it
are troubled with troubles almost every minute.
You ought to be thankful, a whole heaping lot,
for the places and people you?re lucky you?re not!

Just suppose for example,
you lived in Ga-Zayt
and got caught in the traffic
on Zaty Highway Eight!

Or suppose,
just for instance,
you lived in Ga-Zair
with your bedroom up here
and your bathroom up THERE!

Suppose, just suppose, you were poor Herbie Hart,
who has taken his Throm-dim-bu-lator apart!
He never will get it together, I?m sure.
He never will know if the Gick or the Goor
fits into the Skrux or the Snux or the Snoor.
Yes, Duckie, you?re lucky you?re not Herbie Hart
who has taken his Throm-dim-bu-lator apart!

Think they work you too hard??
Think of poor Ali Sard!
He has to mow grass in his uncle?s back yard
and it?s quick-growing grass
and it grows as he mows it.
The faster he mows it, the faster he grows it.
And all that his stingy old uncle will pay
for his shoving that mower around in the hay
is the piffulous pay of two Dooklas a day.
And Ali can?t live on such piffulous pay!

SO?

He has to paint flagpoles
on Sundays in Grooz.
How lucky you are
you don?t live in his shoes!

And poor Mr. Bix!
Every morning at six,
poor Mr. Bix has his Borfin to fix!

It doesn?t seem fair. It just doesn?t seem right,
but his Borfin just seems to go shlump every night.
It shlumps in a heap, sadly needing repair.
Bix figures it?s due to the local night air.

It takes him all day to un-shlump it.
And then?
the night air comes back
and it shlumps once again!

So don?t you feel blue. Don?t get down in the dumps.
You?re lucky you don?t have a Borfin with shlumps.

And, while we are at it, consider the Schlottz,
the Crumple-horn, Web-footed, Green-bearded Schlottz,
whose tail is entailed with un-solvable knots.

If he isn?t muchly
more worse off than you,
I?ll eat my umbrella.
That?s just what I?ll do.

And you?re lucky, indeed, you don?t ride a camel.
To ride on a camel, you sit on a wamel.
A wamel, you know, is a sort of a saddle
held on by a button that?s known as a faddle.
And, boy! If your old wamel-faddle gets loose,
I?m telling you, Duckie, you?re gone like a goose.

And poor Mr. Potter,
T-crosser,
I-dotter.
He has to cross t?s
and he has to dot i?s
in an I-and-T factory
out in Van Nuys!

Oh, the jobs people work at!
Out west, near Hawtch-Hawtch,
there?s a Hawtch-Hawtcher Bee-Watcher.
His job is to watch?
is to keep both his eyes on the lazy town bee.
A bee that is watched will work harder, you see.

Well?he watched and he watched.
But, in spite of his watch,
that bee didn?t work any harder. Not Mawtch.

So somebody said,
?Our old-bee-watching man
just isn?t bee-watching as hard as he can.
He ought to be watched by another Hawtch-Hawtcher!
The thing that we need
is a Bee-Watcher-Watcher!?

WELL?

The Bee-Watcher-Watcher watched the Bee-Watcher.
He didn?t watch well. So another Hawtch-Hawtcher
had to come in as a Watch-Watcher-Watcher!
And today all the Hawtchers who live in Hawtch-Hawtch
are watching on Watch-Watcher-Watchering-Watch,
Watch-Watching the Watcher who?s watching the bee.
You?re not a Hawtch-Watcher. You?re lucky, you see!

And how fortunate you?re not Professor de Breeze
who has spent the past thirty-two years, if you please,
Trying to teach Irish ducks how to read Jivvanese.

And think of the
poor puffing Poogle-Horn Players,
who have to parade
down the Poogle-Horn Stairs
every morning to wake up
the Prince of Poo-Boken.
It?s awful how often
their poogles get broken!

And, oh! Just suppose
you were poor Harry Haddow.
Try as he will
he can?t make any shadow!

He thinks that, perhaps, something?s wrong with his Gizz.
And I think that, by golly, there probably is.

And the Brothers Ba-zoo.
The poor Brothers Ba-zoo!
Suppose your hair grew
like theirs happened to do!
You think your unlucky??
I?m telling you, Duckie,
some people are muchly,
oh, ever so muchly,
muchly more-more-more unlucky than you!

And suppose that you lived in that forest in France,
where the average young person just hasn?t a chance
to escape from the perilous pants-eating-plants!
But your pants are safe! you?re a fortunate guy.
And you ought to be shouting, ?How lucky am I!?

And , speaking of plants,
you should be greatly glad-ish
you?re not Farmer Falkenberg?s
seventeenth radish.

And you?re so, so lucky
you?re not Gucky Gown,
who lives by himself
ninety miles out of town,
in the Ruins of Ronk.
Ronk is rather run-down.

And you?re so, so, So lucky
you?re not a left sock,
left behind by mistake
in the Kaverns of Krock!

Thank goodness for all of the things you are not!
Thank goodness you?re not something someone forgot,
and left all alone in some punkerish place
like a rusty tin coat hanger handing in space.

That?s why I say, ?Duckie!
Don?t grumble! Don?t stew!
Some critters are much-much,
oh, ever so much-much,
so muchly much-much more unlucky than you!?

?Dr. Seuss
